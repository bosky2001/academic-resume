abstract: In this study, we describe the most ultralightweight living legged
  robot to date that makes it a strong candidate for a search and rescue
  mission. The robot is a living beetle with a wireless electronic backpack
  stimulator mounted on its thorax. Inheriting from the living insect, the robot
  employs a compliant body made of soft actuators, rigid exoskeletons, and
  flexure hinges. Such structure would allow the robot to easily adapt to any
  complex terrain due to the benefit of soft interface, self-balance, and
  self-adaptation of the insect without any complex controller. The antenna
  stimulation enables the robot to perform not only left/right turning but also
  backward walking and even cessation of walking. We were also able to grade the
  turning and backward walking speeds by changing the stimulation frequency. The
  power required to drive the robot is low as the power consumption of the
  antenna stimulation is in the order of hundreds of microwatts. In contrast to
  the traditional legged robots, this robot is of low cost, easy to construct,
  simple to control, and has ultralow power consumption.
