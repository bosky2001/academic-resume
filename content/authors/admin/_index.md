Hi, I'm Hien! I'm a doctoral student in the [MEAM](https://www.me.upenn.edu/) department and [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at University of Pennsylvania. 
I work at [DAIR Lab](https://dair.seas.upenn.edu/) under my supervisor [Michael Posa](https://dair.seas.upenn.edu/michael-posa/). 

I graduated with a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering (specialized in Robotics and Mechatronics) from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) in Singapore.
Before starting my PhD at Penn, I worked at [Eureka Robotics](https://eurekarobotics.com/) as Robotics Engineer for 3 years, building [Archimedes Robot](https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/09/eureka-robotics-new-robotic-arm-is-designed-for-optical-lenses-and-mirrors/), an ultra-precise optics handling robotic system.

My research interest is exploring robot learning for manipulation in various contact-sensitive tasks.
